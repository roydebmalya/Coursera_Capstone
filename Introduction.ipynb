    "I have been working in the city of Dubai since 2017 and what I found that the city has its own peculiar way of expanding and settling the influx of population in the city unlike any other city in the Wordl. Dubai is part of United Arab Emirates with a population of around **3.35 Million** people (Estimated as of 2019). \n",

Once we find the most popular Sector, try to understand the Venues in each Communities (Neighbourhood) and Cluster them.
